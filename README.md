# MongoDB Atlas Python Connection

This repository provides code examples and a reference for connecting to a MongoDB Atlas cluster using Python and PyMongo. It follows the steps outlined in the Medium article titled ["Connecting to MongoDB Atlas with Python (PyMongo)"](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/connecting-to-mongodb-atlas-with-python-pymongo-5b25dab3ac53).

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Install the PyMongo package by running `pip install pymongo` in your Python environment.
- Set up a MongoDB Atlas account and create a cluster.

## Usage

Follow these steps to use the code:

1. Replace the `uri` variable with your own MongoDB Atlas connection string.
2. Run the code to establish a connection with your MongoDB Atlas cluster.
3. Check the printed message to ensure a successful connection.

Note: This code assumes you have already installed the necessary dependencies and have a valid MongoDB Atlas cluster set up.

## Code

The code in this repository demonstrates the following:

- Establishing a connection to a MongoDB Atlas cluster
- Accessing a specific database and collection
- Performing CRUD operations (insert, delete, update) on MongoDB documents
